1.Why should you make your html accessable?
---------------------------------------------
   There are several reasons why you should make your HTML accessible. First and foremost, accessibility allows people
   with disabilities to access and use your content and interact with your website.

   Additionally, accessibility can improve the user experience for everyone, not just people with disabilities. 
   For example, using semantic HTML tags can make your content easier to understand and navigate, and using proper contrast and clear, readable fonts can make your website more pleasant to look at and use.

2.What are landmarks in a html page and why should you have them?

Landmarks in an HTML page are special HTML tags that provide a way to quickly navigate to specific sections of a page.
Landmarks are particularly useful for people who use screen readers to navigate websites, as screen readers often have shortcut keys or commands that allow users to jump directly to specific landmarks on a page.

Having landmarks on your page can make your content more accessible and user-friendly, as it provides a way for users to quickly navigate to the content they are looking for.

3.What are semantic elements and why should you use them?

Semantic elements are HTML tags that provide meaning to the content they contain. In other words,
semantic elements are used to indicate the purpose or meaning of the content within the element, rather than just its appearance.

Using semantic elements can make your HTML more readable and easier to understand, as it provides context and meaning to the content on your page.

Overall, using semantic elements is a best practice for writing clean and accessible HTML code.

4. When do you use the role attribute?

The role attribute is used to indicate the purpose or role of an HTML element. 
And The role attribute is particularly useful for elements that do not have a semantic HTML tag, or for custom elements that do not have a default role.

For example, if you have a custom element that acts as a button, but is not a <button> element, you can use the role="button" attribute to indicate that the
element should be treated as a button by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Overall, the role attribute is a useful tool for providing additional context and meaning to HTML elements, and can improve the accessibility of your website.
